                            <p class="mb-30">This was my entry for the Mobond UX/UI Hackathon held at VJTI, Mumbai, India in December 2018. I stood 32nd out of 200 participants and recieved a 'Quality Design Certification'. <br><br>Spotting pain points and trying to redesign inconvenient human experiences from everyday life is something I find extremely enjoyable. Commute is an essential part of our everyday routine. Having used Mumbai Local Trains for over two years now, I could not help but notice that I myself had gotten used to workarounds on the App’s UI - ignoring the time it took to navigate through the app.<br>So I took up the long overdue challenge to redesign the m-Indicator app.  </p>

                                <p>The app lacked a bottom navigation panel. A lot of important features such as chat & safety were tucked away under the main menu. I bought them from there onto the bottom navigation so that it’s easy to access for users who are worried about their safety while in the train. m-Indicator’s response for any safety calls are impressive, they respond almost immediately. But most users would not know where the safety tab is, because it isn’t something they click on everyday. For features like this, it makes sense if they are as ‘searchable’ as possible, so that when users need it, they can find it.<br><br>
                                    As a student using the train for my daily commute, I can attest that the train chat feature is a very frequently used feature on the app. Again, this feature too, was tucked away under the main menu. I placed it on the bottom navigation so that it’s easier to check for updates, respond to other users and inform other passengers.</p>

                                    <p>As a student using the train for my daily commute, I can attest that the train chat feature is a very frequently used feature on the app. Again, this feature too, was tucked away under the main menu. I placed it on the bottom navigation so that it’s easier to check for updates, respond to other users and inform other passengers.</p>
                                    <img class = "persona" style = "width: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" src = "images/botnav.png">
                                </div>
                            </div>

                                    <div class = "row">
                                <div class = "col-md-12">
                                    <p><b>4. Train route user flow</b></p>
                                    <p>To explain this, I’ll take the example of booking a train from Bandra to Santacruz. The app supports multiple ways to achieve this.</p>
                                    <p><b>Case 1:</b></p>
                                    <p>First, we search for our source station. The app has only two slots for recent searches, which can make searching quite inconvenient. Once we find our station, Dadar, we click on it. Now a dropdown appears which reveals several destination stations. None of them have Santacruz, so the app assumes that the user knows which route will have Santacruz has a stop. This is can be a nightmare, even for trained users.</p>
                                    <img class = "persona" style = "height: 70vh; width: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" src = "images/case1.gif">
                                    <p>I then get a list of trains, with their displayed train timings and platform numbers. On clicking on a train, I get a display of all it’s stops. If I click on a stop, I can extend this route to the next stop. But I only know this once I have completed these many steps. However, this train list is concise and informative.
                                    </p>

                                    <p><b>Case 2:</b></p>
                                    <p>If you observe closely, there is a button called ‘A to B’ on top of the train menu. This section allows me to select a source, destination and their respective timings. On entering my station names, I get a single result of the train and it’s timing, with the list of stops in between. There is also an option to add a middle station ‘via’, an option for a faster option ‘speed it’ and buttons to move to the next train in the time schedule. </p>
                                    <img class = "persona" style = "height: 70vh; width: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" src = "images/case2.gif">
                                    <p>Now, from these two case studies, I realised that the searching method of Case 2 was more effective and useful than that in Case 1, and the result display of Case 1 was better than that of Case 2.
                                        <br><br>
                                        My main focus with designing this section of the app was to reduce the cognitive stress, as much as possible, to enable a user to check their route as quickly as possible. Since most people are now familiar with the ‘pick up and drop off’ interface of apps such as Uber, Swiggy (Food delivery) and Google Maps, I incorporated it to create a new, faster search method. The map interface makes it easier to find the desired route. It is also inspired by the interface of the Automated Ticket Vending Machines (ATVMs) installed on each station in Mumbai. Although a diversion from the original design, it will be easy to adapt to, thanks to its familiarity with delivery/transportation apps and the ATVM.

                                    <p><b>5. Train Results Display</b></p>
                                    <p>I also redesigned the train results page. I added the search bar on the top, to easily modify the search if needed. The original design had shortfroms, which can be confusing and frustrating for new users or even regular users who wish to use a different line. <br><br>Further, the train stops dropdown also features arrows to indicate which side of the train the platform will come on. This is particularly useful during rush hours, where moving through the crowd can be a mammoth task.

                                    <p>I modified the chat window. I incorporated the features to reply to a message, report a message or like a message on the message bubble itself. Further, I also cleaned up the old top navigation bar and intriduced a hamburger menu for the same. Additionally, I added the button on top to quickly switch between different lines.
                                    </p>

                                            <p>I also redesigned the UI of the Bus Search feature. It is split in three sections:<br>Search by source and destination<br>Search by bus number<br>Search by bus stop

                                1. How helpful Material Design is! I gained a lot of insight from how Google made this design framework. It helped me understand the difference between Mobile UI and Web UI, which I have done a lot of before.<br><br>

                                2. Redesigning an app the way I would use it was a very gratifying experience. However, I was cautious of not being trapped in my own sense of reality. To do so, I looked at different perspectives while solving an issue that is faced by not just me, but a thousand others.<br><br>

                                3. Since this app is used by thousands of commuters daily, I wanted most of the design to seem “invisible”. So I decided to retain the earlier color scheme. This, although, was challenging, as red and black is a tough scheme to balance. It took time and effort to get it right, but it was a great experience.
